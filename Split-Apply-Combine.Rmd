##Purpose
Look into weather and see how it impacts the seasonality of bike commuting


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# issues with running the chunks of code. work around was to put the Rmd file in the same location as the project directory

library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(modelr)
library(purrr)
library(broom)

```

```{r load data}
# loading the load_counts.R script
source("code/load_counts.R")
# ^because the function itself calls the function, we don't have to also call it here

```

'dplyr' joins. Left join below returns each row in bike counts with easch matching weather row, binding by date. For more, check out the cheat sheet. 
```{r join data}
# will be joining weather to bike counts

bike_count_wx <-  bike_counts %>% 
  left_join(weather, by = c("date" = "DATE")) %>%  # x= bikecountwx
  select(date, bridge, total, TMIN, TMAX, PRCP)

```

```{r explore data}
bike_count_wx %>%  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = total,
       group = bridge, color = bridge)) +
  geom_line() + facet_grid(bridge ~ .) #facet_wrap(bridge ~ .) is a different option

bike_count_wx %>%  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = total,
       group = bridge, color = bridge)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(bridge ~ .) 

bike_count_wx %>%  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = total,
       group = bridge, color = bridge)) +
  geom_line() + facet_grid(bridge ~ .) + ylim(c(0,10000))

```

```{r explore some summary stats}
# average daily by bridge count
bike_count_wx %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(bridge) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(avg_daily = mean(total))

# average monthly by bridge count by year
bike_counts %>%
  dplyr::group_by(bridge, month(date), year(date)) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(avg_monthly = mean(total)) %>% 
  View()

# Daily average by month all time by bridge count
avg_monthly  <-  bike_counts %>%
  dplyr::group_by(bridge, month = month(date, label = T)) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(avg_monthly_counts = mean(total)) %>% 
# ^since we're using a month label, we need to reassign the variable to then pipe it to ggplot
  as.data.frame()

str(avg_monthly)

ggplot(avg_monthly, aes(x = month, y = avg_monthly_counts, color = bridge))+
  geom_point(size = 2)
  

```


## Fitting models in R
```{r model fitting}
# models return list objects describing fit

fit <- lm(total ~ TMIN + TMAX + PRCP + bridge, #total is the dependent variable
          data = bike_count_wx)
# ^fits a model of total daily counts against the 4 variables we chose

str(fit)
summary(fit)

plot(fit)

fit2 <- lm(log(total) ~ TMIN + TMAX + PRCP + bridge,
           data = bike_count_wx)
plot(fit2)

lm(total ~ TMIN + TMAX + PRCP + bridge, 
          data = bike_count_wx) %>% summary()

fit_poly <- lm(total ~ TMIN + TMAX + PRCP + bridge, 
          data = bike_count_wx)
summary(fit_poly)

coef(fit_poly)# could access coefs here by name or position

f <- function(x) {198 * x + -0.99 * x^2} # from regression result
p <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = 0),
            mapping = aes(x = x))
p + stat_function(fun = f, color = "blue", size = 2)+
  xlim(0,110) +xlab("deg F") + ylab("count")

```
